NYCGeoClientGeoREST
===================
Since there are 6 underlying services that could be called, certain keys are required (basically taken right from the Geoclient API doc for each method).

Depending on which keys are present (name for PLACE searches, houseNumber for ADDRESS, bin for BIN, etc.) the wrappers routes to a different Geoclient URL.

Borough is required for Geoclient, but I just default to Manhattan if it isnâ€™t specified for no particular reason.
